#What is a loop? 
#Loop repeats code 
#Python uses WHILE and FOR loops 

#Repeat this loop 3 times 
# for number in range(3):
#     #print Hello each time the loops runs
#     print("Hello")



#While LOOPS 
#A WHILE loop repeats while a condition is true 
#Create a starting variable 
# number=1
# #keep looping while number is less than or equal to 5
# while number<=5:
#     #print the current value of number
#     print(number)
#     #Add 1 to number after each loop 
#     number+=1

#Make sure something changes inside a WHILE loop. Other wise you may create an infinite loop 

#WHILE Loops with user input 
#A while loop is useful when you want to keep asking until a user gives a valid answer 

#Ask user for their age 
# age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
# #Keep looping if the age is less than 1 OR greater than 120 
# while age <1 or age > 120:
#     #tell the user their input was invalid 
#     print("Invalid age")
#     #Ask the user to enter their age again 
#     age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
# #This runs after loop finishes
# #Loop stops once the condition becomes FALSE 
# print("Age is valid")

#FOR LOOPS 
#A for loop works through items one a time 

#Create a list containing anything 
# games=["Minecraft","Mario","Zelda"]
# #Take one item from the games list at a time 
# for i in games:
#     #print the current game
#     print(i)


#Using RANGE()
#Range() is a sequence of numbers 

#Start at 2 and stop before 8
# for number in range(2,8):
#      #2 is our starting point and we will stop before 8
#      #Print the current number 
#      print(number)
#      #Remember the ending number in range() is not included 

#Loop through 2-7
# for number in range(2,8):
#     #multiply the number by itself 
#     square=number*number
#     #print the squared number
#     print(square)


#Looping through strings 
# A string can be looped through one character at a time 
#Store a string value inside a variable
# word="Tanks"
# #Take one character from the string at a time 
# for letter in word:
#     #prints the current letter
#     print(letter)
    

#Using BREAK 
#Break stops a loop early 
#loop through number 1-10 
# for number in range(1,11):
#     #print the current number 
#     print(number)
#     #Want to stop the loop when number is equal to 5 
#     if number==5:
#         #Stops the loop immediately 
#         break 


#Nested Loops 
#Nested loop is a loop inside another loop 
#Outer loop that runs through 1,2,3
# for number in range(1,4):
#     #inner loop also runs through 1,2,3
#     for number2 in range(1,4):
#         #print the currernt value from both loops 
#         print(number,number2)



#CHOOSING THE RIGHT LOOP 
#Use a while loop when repetition depends on a condition 
#Keep looping while answer is not yes 
answer=input("Ehat kind of pet person are you")
while answer =="cat" or answer=="dog":
    print("generic answer")
    answer=input("Ehat kind of pet person are you")
print("Rare pet")

    

# #USE a FOR loop when working through items 
# #go through each item in the list 
# itemlist=[]
# for item in itemlist:
#     #print the current item 
#     print(item)

# #USE FOR with range() when working through numbers 
# #Loop through numbers 1-10 
# for number in range(1,11):
#     #print the current number 
#     print(number)
